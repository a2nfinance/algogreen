# Vision
Algogreen aims to become a comprehensive platform that provides support to organizations and projects related to the environment through fundraising and the exchange of carbon offset credits.
# Description
## 1. Overview
Algogreen offers features that enable DAOs to manage loans, allowing individuals and organizations easy and transparent access to loans for project development. Additionally, it tokenizes Real World Assets (carbon offset credits) using the Algorand platform, enabling the trading of carbon credits to help people raise capital, expand production, and repay their loans.

Algogreen can be seen as the beginning of combining ideas from DAOs, DeFi, along with Real World Assets and a fractionalized NFT marketplace.

## 2. Demo information

Algogreen is divided into three applications:

**Application 1:** [admin-algogreen](https://admin-algogreen.a2n.finance) allows administrators to review and approve organizations, projects, and carbon offset credits.

**Application 2:** [defi-algogreen](https://defi-algogreen.a2n.finance) enables organizations and projects to implement lending and borrowing activities.

**Application 3:** [marketplace-algogreen](https://marketplace-algogreen.a2n.finance) allows the trading of verified carbon credits, providing mechanisms to prevent fraud in transactions


## 3. Key features
**Approval system:** All decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), projects, or carbon credits must undergo approval with clear project information and content before they can participate in lending, fundraising, or trading on the marketplace.

**DAOs management:** Any verified organization can create on-chain DAOs using Algorand. These organizations can establish lending programs with different interest rates and approve loans through voting on DAO proposals. The process is executed through smart contracts to ensure transparency and clarity.

**Eco-friendly project support:** Approved projects can access loans through DAO lending programs. Eco-friendly projects with favorable interest rates can issue carbon credits to strengthen their cash flow.

 **Marketplace for carbon credits:** Once projects are approved and their carbon credits are verified, these credits can be listed on the marketplace for sale. The marketplace offers auction features, allowing buyers to bid and purchase a desired quantity of credits without the need to buy the entire quantity listed by the seller. This mechanism provides liquidity for both sellers and buyers.

**Decentralized smart contracts:** All DAOs, loan proposals, and carbon credits are managed by separate smart contracts, without any central smart contract playing a role in holding and transferring funds. This reduces financial risks, makes it easy to update and fix errors, and allows for changes.


## 4. How Algogreen operates
**Basic processes**

Algogreen admins will participate in every process requiring verification and validation to minimize the potential for misinformation. After DAOs, projects, and requests to issue carbon credits are approved, they can then be utilized, leveraging the system's features.

Once an organization is verified, they can announce the loan programs they are deploying. Subsequently, projects can approach and submit loan requests with favorable interest rates. The entire approval process and proposal submission are executed through smart contracts, ensuring transparency for all parties involved.

In the case of collateral-based loan requests, the lending organization and the borrower must collaborate manually to agree on terms before intervening in the cash flow.

Currently, the defi-algogreen application only supports transparency related to asset collateral and does not support collateralization with digital assets.

## 5. Technical implementation

All of our web applications are built on a common architecture. We utilize Beaker, Pyteal, and Algokit for the development and testing of Algorand applications.

## 6. Future development

During our participation in the Hackathon, we've contemplated extensively on Algogreen and its foundational idea. Is this indeed a sound and promising concept? Will it gain support from the community? Will it be competitive enough with other contenders in the future? These are numerous thoughts, and we've also outlined a long-term roadmap to refine Algogreen. However, one important aspect is that we recognize the trustworthiness when developing a product on the Algorand platform. We hope to have the opportunity to continue learning and advancing Algogreen within the Algorand ecosystem, at least for the main purpose of creating something of value for the environment and those involved in environmental work.

## 7. Conclusion

The one-month duration of the hackathon may not be long, but during this time, we've learned from the basics to more advanced aspects related to Algorand technology. Despite facing some initial challenges, what we truly experienced was a sense of "wow".

We would like to express our gratitude to the Algorand ecosystem, including the Algorand Developer YouTube channel, an incredibly detailed documentation system, a network of open-source resources, tutorials, assistance from the Discord channel, and, especially, the stable and low-error technology platform provided by Algorand. It felt like driving a supercar with a solid frame. Once again, thank you, Build-a-Bull Algorand hackathon!
